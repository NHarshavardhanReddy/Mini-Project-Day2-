        <p><Strong>The RajaSaab</Strong> is an upcoming Indian Telugu-language romantic horror comedy film written and
            directed by
            Maruthi, and produced by People Media Factory and IVY Entertainment.[4] The film stars Prabhas, alongside
            Sanjay Dutt, Nidhhi Agerwal, Malavika Mohanan (in her Telugu film debut), Riddhi Kumar.[5][6]

            The project was officially announced in January 2024, though principal photography began earlier in October
            2022.[7] The film's music is composed by Thaman S, with cinematography by Karthik Palani and editing by
            Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao.[8]

            The film is scheduled to release worldwide on 9 January 2026, coinciding with Sankranti.
            In 2022, director Maruthi narrated a horror comedy script to Prabhas to which he agreed. While Prabhas was
            already shooting Salaar and Kalki 2898 AD, he decided to shoot for the film simultaneously and Maruthi began
            pre-production work.[12] The film marks the maiden collaboration between Prabhas and Maruthi, and Maruthi
            called it a ‚Äúgolden opportunity‚Äù to direct a star like Prabhas.[13]

            The film was tentatively titled Raja Deluxe, to be produced by DVV Entertainment, however, production was
            later transferred to People Media Factory.[14] Several titles like Royal and Ambassador were considered,[15]
            however, the title The Raja Saab was announced in January 2024 on the occasion of Sankranti.[16] It is
            reported that the film takes place at the backdrop of an old cinema theatre.[17] Prabhas reportedly plays
            dual roles in the film, as the owner of an theatre and another as a ghost, playing both grandson and
            grandfather.[18]

            Several actresses like Raashii Khanna and Sreeleela were considered for the film,[19] before signing
            Malavika Mohanan, Nidhhi Agerwal and Riddhi Kumar as the three lead actresses.[17][20] Nayanthara was also
            roped in for a special song.[21] Later, Sanjay Dutt and Boman Irani also joined the film for important
            roles.[22]</p>

        <p>The <mark>Ranbir Kapoor</mark>-starrer Animal registered a minimal drop in box office revenue on its 12th day
            of release.
            According to the industry tracker Sacnilk, Animal made around Rs 13 crore on its second Tuesday, after
            earning Rs 13.8 crore on Monday. The film delivered the biggest second-weekend haul in Hindi movie history,
            when it collected Rs 87 crore in total. After 12 days in theatres, Animal has made Rs 458 crore in India.

            Animal‚Äôs box office collections have been astronomical, and all signs point to Animal leaping past the Rs
            500 crore mark domestically this weekend. This is the film‚Äôs last real window to perform, before Shah Rukh
            Khan‚Äôs Dunki and Prabhas‚Äô Salaar land in theatres on December 21 and 22, respectively. Animal is all set to
            become the fourth Hindi film of the year to pass the Rs 500 crore mark, after Pathaan, Gadar 2 and Jawan.
            The film‚Äôs global gross collections stand at least Rs 750 crore at present, roughly Rs 250-Rs 300 crore shy
            of Pathaan and Jawan‚Äôs records.</p>
